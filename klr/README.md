Khaling UniMorph data

According to https://www.academia.edu/3219763/Derivational_morphology_in_Khaling, it seems that multiple argument marking refers to stem alternations, with multiple arguments expressed by presence or absence of an ARG prefix to an agreement feature. 

We map the original encoding as follows

	XY    -> XY
	ARGXY -> XY-1

i.e., a language-specific ranking in the original data

	(unmarked) > ARG-marked

We presume that this corresponds to the following ranking

	SBJ > OBJ/OTH

However, this needs to be confirmed by a language expert
