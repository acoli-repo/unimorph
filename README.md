UniMorph Data
=============

This repository contains UniMorph data for several languages which are investigated by the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) lab at Goethe University Frankfurt,  the associated project "Linked Open Dictionaries" (LiODi), or provided by the Unimorph community (http://unimorph.github.io/).

Note that this is an exploratory fork and supposed to feed back into a future version of Unimorph.
