# gml: Middle Low German 
following Agathe Lasch (1914), Mittelniederdeutsche Grammatik, Niemeyer, Halle, http://www.rostocker-liederbuch.de/darl/index.php?id=81

## Notes
 - the orthography is scientific, not as found in documents (where multiple orthographies compete)
 - strong and weak inflection for adjectives are rendered as "INDF" and "DEF" because they are distributionally connected with the occurrence of the definite article (and the terms "definite" and "indefinite" are occasionally used for these inflection classes)
 - strong and weak inflection for nouns are expressed as LGSPEC-strong and LGSPEC-weak because they are not connected with an article; diachronically, these may originate from pronominal affixes as in Baltic, but this is not generally accepted
 - demonstrative pronouns are rendered as PRO/DET, without classifying the deictic function
 - interrogative pronouns are rendered as PRO;INT, but the INT feature is originally supposed to apply to verbs, not to pronouns
 - infinitive is rendered imprecisely as V;NFIN, the nominalized infinitive as V.MSDR (if marked for nominal inflection)
 - we annotate all categories, also if expressed by zero morphology (e.g., NOM)
 - as the Unimorph categories provide a partial match only, the original data is preserved in subdirectory src/
